# Tech Product Document: AI Agent Communication Platform

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the technical specifications and feasibility assessment for a platform enabling communication between AI agents (specifically Claude Code and Gemini CLI) using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) within Docker containers. The platform will feature a web-based interface to monitor and interact with these agents, displaying their terminal outputs side-by-side.

## 2. Dockerization Strategy
To ensure portability, isolation, and ease of deployment, both Claude Code and Gemini CLI will be deployed within separate Docker containers. A third container will host the web interface and its Python backend.

### 2.1. Claude Code Container
- **Base Image**: Given Claude Code's requirement for Node.js 18+ and compatibility with Ubuntu 20.04+, an Ubuntu-based Node.js image will be suitable. This addresses the user's concern about Windows compatibility.
- **Installation**: The `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` command will be executed within the Dockerfile to install Claude Code globally.
- **Entrypoint**: The container's entrypoint will be configured to start Claude Code, potentially in a mode that allows for MCP server interaction or exposes its terminal output.
- **MCP Integration**: Claude Code's native MCP integration will be leveraged. The container will expose a port for MCP communication, allowing other containers (like the Gemini CLI or a dedicated MCP server) to interact with it.

### 2.2. Gemini CLI Container
- **Base Image**: Similar to Claude Code, an Ubuntu-based Node.js 20+ image will be used for the Gemini CLI container.
- **Installation**: The `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` command will be used for installation.
- **Entrypoint**: The container will be configured to run the Gemini CLI, enabling it to act as an MCP client or server as needed.
- **MCP Integration**: Gemini CLI's ability to use MCP servers will be crucial. This container will either connect to a central MCP server or directly to the Claude Code container via MCP.

### 2.3. Web Interface Container
- **Base Image**: A Python-based image (e.g., `python:3.9-slim-buster` or `python:3.11-slim-bullseye`) will be used for the Flask backend. For the frontend, if React is chosen, a Node.js image might be used for building, with the static files served by the Flask app or a separate Nginx container.
- **Backend (Python/Flask)**: The backend will handle WebSocket connections from the frontend and manage communication with the Docker containers. It will act as an intermediary, forwarding commands to the AI agents and streaming their terminal outputs back to the web interface.
- **Frontend (HTML/React)**: A simple HTML page or a React application will provide the user interface. It will establish WebSocket connections to the backend to send commands and receive real-time terminal output from the AI agents. The side-by-side terminal display will be a key feature.
- **MCP Interaction**: The web interface container will likely not directly implement MCP. Instead, the Python backend will translate web requests into MCP messages and vice-versa, interacting with the Claude Code and Gemini CLI containers through their exposed MCP ports.

## 3. MCP Protocol Implementation in Docker
MCP's client-server architecture is well-suited for a Dockerized environment. Each AI agent (Claude Code and Gemini CLI) can act as an MCP host, exposing its capabilities through an MCP server running within its container. A central MCP server (either a standalone container or integrated into one of the AI agent containers) could orchestrate communication, or the agents could communicate directly if the MCP specification allows for peer-to-peer connections.

### 3.1. Communication Flow
1. User sends a command via the web interface.
2. The Python backend receives the command via WebSocket.
3. The backend translates the command into an appropriate MCP message.
4. The MCP message is sent to the target AI agent's Docker container (e.g., Claude Code).
5. The AI agent processes the command and generates output.
6. The AI agent's output (including terminal logs) is captured and sent back to the Python backend, potentially via MCP or a separate logging mechanism.
7. The Python backend streams the output to the web interface via WebSocket.
8. The web interface displays the output in the respective terminal window.

### 3.2. Networking
- Docker's internal networking will be used to facilitate communication between the containers. A custom Docker network will be created to ensure secure and isolated communication.
- Ports for MCP communication and WebSocket connections will be exposed internally within the Docker network.

## 4. Feasibility Assessment

### 4.1. Technical Feasibility
- **Docker Containerization**: Highly feasible. Both Claude Code and Gemini CLI are Node.js applications, which are easily containerized. Ubuntu base images provide the necessary environment.
- **MCP Protocol**: Highly feasible. MCP is designed for LLM-tool integration and supports client-server communication, which aligns perfectly with the Dockerized setup. The documentation for MCP is publicly available and provides guidance on building servers and clients.
- **WebSockets for Terminal Display**: Highly feasible. WebSockets are ideal for real-time, bidirectional communication, making them perfect for streaming terminal output to a web interface. Libraries for WebSockets are readily available in Python (e.g., `websockets`, `Flask-SocketIO`) and JavaScript.
- **Side-by-Side Terminal Display**: Feasible. Frontend frameworks like React or even plain HTML/CSS can be used to create a responsive layout for multiple terminal windows. Libraries like `xterm.js` can be used to render interactive terminals in the browser.

### 4.2. Challenges and Considerations
- **MCP Server Implementation**: While MCP is an open protocol, implementing a robust MCP server within each AI agent container (if not natively supported by the CLI tools for direct interaction) will require careful development.
- **Terminal Output Capture**: Capturing and streaming real-time terminal output from within the Docker containers to the Python backend will require careful handling of process I/O (e.g., `subprocess` module in Python).
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Securely managing API keys and user authentication for Claude Code and Gemini CLI within the Dockerized environment will be critical. Environment variables and Docker secrets can be used.
- **Resource Management**: Running multiple AI agents and a web server in Docker containers might require significant computational resources (CPU, RAM), especially with LLM inference. Performance monitoring will be essential.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Robust error handling and centralized logging across all containers will be necessary for debugging and maintenance.

## 5. Conclusion
Based on the research, building a platform that allows Claude Code and Gemini CLI to communicate via MCP within Docker containers and be monitored through a web interface with side-by-side terminals is technically feasible. The core technologies (Docker, Node.js, Python, WebSockets, MCP) are well-suited for this task. While there are implementation challenges, they appear surmountable with careful design and development.

## 6. Next Steps
- Detail the MCP communication flow and message structures.
- Design the API for the Python backend.
- Select specific frontend technologies (e.g., React, `xterm.js`).
- Outline the Dockerfile specifications for each container.
- Plan for authentication and secret management.
- Consider persistent storage for agent data/configurations.
